1. Use Lists to Store Orders: You can use lists to store your entry, SO, and TP orders. This allows you to manage multiple orders more easily. For example, you can add an order to the list when it's placed, and remove it when it's hit. This also makes it easier to calculate the average price and total quantity.

2. Use Objects to Store Order Information: Instead of using separate variables for each order's quantity, price, and status, you can use an object to store all the information for each order. This makes your code more organized and easier to understand.

3. Use Functions to Handle Common Tasks: You can create functions to handle common tasks such as placing an order, updating the total funds and quantity, and calculating the average price. This reduces code duplication and makes your code easier to maintain.

4. Use a Loop to Handle Multiple TPs and SOs: If you have multiple TPs and SOs, you can use a loop to check if each TP or SO should be hit. This is more efficient than writing separate code for each TP and SO.

How to "upgrade" our strategy script

1. Identify Common Tasks: Look through your existing code and identify tasks that are performed multiple times, such as placing an order, updating the total funds and quantity, calculating the average price, and checking if a TP or SO should be hit.

2. Create Functions for Common Tasks: For each common task, create a function that performs that task. The function should take as input any values that vary between different instances of the task, and return any values that are needed later in the script.

3. Replace Duplicate Code with Function Calls: Replace each instance of a common task in your code with a call to the corresponding function. Make sure to pass the correct arguments to the function and handle the return value(s) appropriately.

4. Organize Orders into Lists: Instead of using separate variables for each TP and SO, organize them into lists. This will make it easier to handle multiple orders in a loop.

5. Use Objects to Store Order Information: Instead of using separate variables for each order's quantity, price, and status, use an object (or a list, in Pine Script) to store all the information for each order.

6. Test Your New Script: After making these changes, test your new script to make sure it still behaves as expected. Check that it places orders at the correct times and prices, and that the total funds, total quantity, and average price are calculated correctly.

Remember, the goal of these improvements is to make your code more organized and easier to maintain, without changing its behavior. If you find that a proposed improvement would change how your script behaves, you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs.







1. Initialize Variables: Set up all the necessary variables for the strategy, including the trading direction, trigger values, and various parameters for the orders.

2. Define Source Function: Define a function to determine the price source based on the user's input.

3. Set Trading Direction: Determine whether the strategy should trade long, short, or both based on the user's input.

4. Place Entry Order: If the conditions for an entry order are met (e.g., the price source is above a certain level, the trading window is open, and various filters are passed), place an entry order. Update the relevant variables, such as the initial order price, the current safety order (SO) count, and the total funds and quantity in trade.

5. Handle Safety Orders (SOs): If the conditions for an SO are met (e.g., the price has reached a certain threshold, the maximum number of SOs has not been exceeded, and various filters are passed), place an SO. Update the relevant variables, including the total funds and quantity in trade, the average price, and the SO count.

6. Update Thresholds: Update the thresholds for placing SOs based on the current price.

7. Handle Take Profit (TP) Orders: If the conditions for a TP order are met (e.g., the price has reached a certain level and the TP has not been hit yet), close a portion of the position. Update the relevant variables, such as the total funds and quantity in trade, the average price, and the TP hit status.

8. Handle Stop Loss (SL) Orders: If the conditions for an SL order are met (e.g., the price has reached a certain level), close the entire position. Update the relevant variables, such as the total funds and quantity in trade, and reset the SO count and TP hit status.

9. Log Information: Log information about the current state of the strategy, such as the total funds and quantity in trade, the average price, and the SO count.

10. Plot Indicators: Plot various indicators on the chart, such as the price source, the thresholds for placing SOs, and the levels for placing TP and SL orders.







To convert this pseudo-code into a new version of your script, you can follow these steps:

1. Create Functions: For each step in the pseudo-code that involves a common task (such as placing an order or updating the total funds and quantity in trade), create a function that performs that task.

2. Replace Code with Function Calls: Replace the corresponding code in your existing script with calls to the new functions. Make sure to pass the correct arguments to each function and handle the return values appropriately.

3. Test the New Script: After replacing all the necessary code, test the new script to make sure it behaves as expected. Check that it places orders at the correct times and prices, and that the total funds, total quantity, and average price are calculated correctly.

4. Refine and Optimize: If necessary, refine and optimize the new script. This could involve adjusting the conditions for placing orders, tweaking the parameters for the strategy, or adding new features.

Remember, the goal is to make your script more organized and easier to maintain, without changing its behavior. If you find that a proposed change would alter how your script behaves, you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs.
